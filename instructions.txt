For this exercise ive chosen the dataset from FAO crop statistics  provided by Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/raghavramasamy/crop-statistics-fao-all-countries

This dataset provides: 
1. crop statistics: sown area by country/product, production by country/product, yield, from 1960 to 2019.
2. Population statistics: population from 1960 to 2019 and forecasts
3. Units flags and information flags


###

*How does this repo works?*

1. docker-compose.yml orchestrates the two containers: a postgresql container that downloads the dataset and pushes it to a DB and a python container that waits for DB to be up and running and makes a few queries before it shuts itself down

2. In /db there are a few entrypoint commands to 1. Make the DB schema 2. Download the data from kaggle 3. Push the data to the DB

3. In /py there is one python script to make queries to the DB

### 

*Comments & Pendings*

1. The DB schema is very simple and should be better designed
2. The queries are very simple; there is much more data and insights to obtain
3. The kaggle API user & key is in plain text
